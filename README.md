# Anime List API

Hey there! This is the Github repo for our Anime List API project. Our team is composed of Brandon and Mario of the Jun 2021 Web Development cohort.

Our project's vision is to create an Anime and Manga API that can search, sort, return information about anime series and characters, and to be able to rate them and post comments.

Our goals for this project are to:

1. Figure out the mechanics of APIs, get, and post with axios.
2. Implement them successfully for our project's purpose
3. Style the web app / API to be usable and aesthetically pleasing for users.
4. Optionally, deploy the site on the fellow ironhacker website for APIs.

We hope you find good use for our API. Thanks for checking our project out!
